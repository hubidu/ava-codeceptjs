## Backlog

- Correct step stacktrace
- Improve codeceptjs errors: for see(text, element): error message should also contain the actual text of the element. So enhance "expected element #logo_homepage_link to include "DuckDuckFoo"" should also contain but found "About DuckDuckGo"
- DONE Add codecept command and parameters to screenshot
- IDEA screenshot gallery of pages: Add a screenshot to the gallery
- IDEA Time ajax requests
- Using say could use t.log
- Extract tags (@...) from test titles
- step stacktrace should be ignored in screenshot output
- IDEA highlight all clickable elements in error screenshots for better trouble shooting
- IDEA Log structured data (like json) for reports
- Replace codeceptjs file upload with a version without global variables
- Remove from stacktraces: at WebDriverIO.wrapped [as see] (C:\\Users\\stefan.huber\\projects\\server-cons
- Can I find out if an element is still being animated (to avoid situations like "Element <svg width="30" height="30">...</svg> is not clickable at point (46, 503). Other element would receive the click: <div class="OnboardingBanner">...</div>")
- Improve element highlighting in screenshots
- Need a cool full-text search to find tests efficiently
- Also save screenshots on failed ava assertions
- Map codeceptjs assertion errors to ava assertion error
- Suppport webdriverio errors
- Better when in headless mode: Would be nice if chrome would not steal the focus
